File Copy Utility

This is a simple tool to copy files from one location to another location. To put it simply, this tool should mimic what
Unix's "cp" command does - copy a file to another file. The idea is to add new functionality to the tool over a period
of time when you learn Python. Also, this exercise helps you learn some of core modules of Python.

The tool broadly will have the following functions:
1. Copy an existing file from one location (directory) to another location.
2. Throw an error when the source file is not existing
3. Throw an error when the destination directory is not existing
4. Ensure that file is copied correctly (meaning the contents of destination file is exactly same as source file). This
   is very important to ensure integrity of the file
5. The tool should be used for copying files of all sizes
6.
