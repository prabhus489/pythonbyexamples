    integral number between 1 and n (both included) and then the program should print the dictionary.
    Suppose the following input is supplied to the program
36. Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in
    the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡¬Y-1.Example Suppose the
    following inputs are given to the program: 3,5Then, the output of the program should be: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
