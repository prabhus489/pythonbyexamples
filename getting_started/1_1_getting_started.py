Python is a cool programming language and there are so many resources 
available. The number of books, online documentation and forums are huge. 
It is the community that makes Python really cool by offering help at a 
critical point. This repository too is trying to make Python programming 
little easier by showing you cool features of Python through examples.\n"""
 
goals = """
The goals are:
    Each of the examples explains a specific feature in Python.
    Keep it simple
    Show code and take about it in very few lines
    Provide try-it-yourself so that you can try to develop/extend the example\n"""

a beginner or a developer trying to refresh your skills. You can go folder by
folder running each examples, try to do all do-it-yourself. Or you can do a
