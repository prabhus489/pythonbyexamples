# This program does nothing but just prints some stream of characters.
# These stream of characters are called as "strings". We will see more
# examples later. But for now, let us understand that anything between
# double quotes is a string and we can print strings using the function
# "print"

print("Hello, World")
print("Make hay while the sun shines")
print("Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish")

# Do It Yourself
# 1. Print some quotations or inspirational messages from famous figure
# 2. Pass number of strings to print function separated by commas and see what
#       happens and observe what happens. Something like
#       print("Hello", "world)
