# This program calculates "area" of square. In this example, we see couple
# of important things - assignments and mathematical operators. Guess what
# the following code does?

side = 4
area = side * side
print(area)

# Do it yourself
# 1. Write a program to calculate area of triangle
# 2. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given its diameter
# 3. Write a program to find out the side of a square given its area
# 4. Write a program to find the volume of a cylinder given its radium and height
